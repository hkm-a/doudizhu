# Game Design Document: {Name}

<!-- This is a REFERENCE template. Sections are flexible:
     - Skip sections that don't apply to this game type
     - Add custom sections if the game needs them
     - The game-planner interview will determine which sections to fill -->

## 1. Game Overview

|-------------|-----------|------------------------|------------|
| {Level 1} | {reach the exit} | {basic movement} | {easy} |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Difficulty progression:** {how difficulty ramps up}

## 7. UI / UX Design

### HUD

- {element}: {purpose} — e.g., Health bar: top-left, shows player HP

### Menu Flow

```
Main Menu → Start Game → Gameplay → Pause Menu → Resume / Quit
                                  → Game Over → Retry / Main Menu
```

### Juice / Feedback

- {screen shake on hit, particle effects, hit flash, etc.}

## 8. Audio Direction

<!-- Users must provide their own audio files. This section describes WHAT is needed. -->

### Music

| Scene/Context | Mood | Notes |

## 10. Scope & Playable Units

### Playable Unit Candidates

<!-- Each candidate is a player-experienced chunk that can become one roadmap tag. -->
